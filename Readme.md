Modeling Intrusion Detection System Using Machine Learning Techniques
=====================================================================

Project Overview
----------------

This project focuses on developing an intrusion detection system (IDS) using machine learning techniques to improve attack detection accuracy and reduce false alarm rates. The system was modeled on the NSL-KDD dataset.

An IDS monitors network traffic and analyzes it to detect potential malicious activity and cyber threats. However, traditional IDS suffer from issues like high false positives, inability to detect novel attacks, and poor performance on imbalanced training data.

To address these challenges, this project employs machine learning algorithms like Random Forest for anomaly detection. The model development process involves data preprocessing, feature extraction, sampling to handle class imbalance, model training and optimization, and performance evaluation.

Methodology
-----------

The project methodology consists of the following key phases:

1.  Data Preprocessing: The raw NSL-KDD dataset is loaded and preprocessed by handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, standardizing numerical attributes, and mapping attack types to categories.
2.  Feature Extraction: Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) is applied in conjunction with Random Forest to select the optimal subset of features for intrusion detection. This reduces dimensionality and improves model performance.
3.  Sampling: The training data is highly imbalanced, with some attack types having very few samples. Random oversampling is used to balance the class distribution.
4.  Model Training: Multiple classification algorithms are trained on the balanced dataset, including KNN, Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, Logistic Regression. Hyperparameter tuning is performed to optimize each model.
5.  Evaluation: Different performance metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, ROC AUC are computed. The results are analyzed to determine the best model.

Results
-------

-   The Random Forest classifier achieved the best performance with 99.9% accuracy and 0.999 F1-score using 10-fold cross validation.
-   Compared to other models, Random Forest had the highest recall and precision for almost all attack categories, indicating a good balance between false positives and false negatives.
-   Feature extraction using RFE improved model accuracy and lowered training time by reducing the number of features from 41 to 10.
-   The system was able to effectively handle class imbalance through random oversampling, leading to improved minority class detection.

Conclusion
----------

The experimental results demonstrate that using ensemble machine learning methods like Random Forest can significantly enhance the performance of anomaly-based intrusion detection systems. The proposed system was able to detect network intrusions with high accuracy and low false alarm rates.

This project provides a practical implementation of how advanced ML techniques can be leveraged to develop more intelligent and robust cybersecurity solutions.
